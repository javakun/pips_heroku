#Requirements Documentation

<h4><h4><h4>Introduction</h4>
This requirement specifications document will serve as a guide for the design and testing of our Web App System P.I.P.S (Projects Investigations for Professors and Students), a system being developed to aid students and other talented individuals organize, join and promote projects of both professional and academic nature.

<h4><h4><h4>Purpose </h4>
The guide outlines the general functional and nonfunctional requirements of the project as both a development tool and evaluation for use of the development team and evaluation purposes for the course ICOM 5016 Database Systems.

<h4><h4>Scope</h4>
Projects Investigations for Professors and Students (PIPS for short) is a proposed professional social network that allows users to, in particular students, to become more involved in professional or personal project endeavors. PIPS is a tool to aid professional growth but also a place to meet others with relevant interests. As a web-based application, PIPS will be accessible from any browser, meaning it can be accessed on mobile devices without need of an application. Users can track the progress of projects they are interested in or browse tags to find information on certain subjects to broaden their experience. Being a professional network, PIPS allows users to upload their Resume for other users to browse. In order to maintain a scholarly atmosphere, users must agree to an End User License Agreement certifying they are 18 years of age or older.
