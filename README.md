<p><b>Concept:</b><br>PIPS is a web-based social network that serves to allow students, professors and other proffesionals to organize and promote both Academic and personal projects. Users are able to organize teams, projects and events, search for projects and events relevant to their interests, and report their progress on the site. This web app aims to provide an easy to use platform for students and independent professionalis alike can find projects and teams that suit their preferences.</p>

<p><b>Frameworks & IDEs:</b><br>Client-Side Framework: Angular.js<br>Server-Side Framework: Node.js<br>DBMS Technology: PostgreSQL <br>IDE: Webstorm</p>
<p><b>Heroku Hosted Hello World:</b>https://pips-heroku-project.herokuapp.com/</p>
<h3>Retrospective Analysis: Sprint 1 </h3>
<p><b>What worked well? </b> <br> Heroku streamlined the process of creating a database, which helped immensely. Mockup design worked well. </br></p>
<p><b>What didn't work well? </b> <br> The project ran into some issues with the previous repository and Heroku synchronization, which led to creating a second repository and project hosted on the cloud. The team also realized that MySQL technologies were less appropriate for the project, given Heroku's much simpler integration of PostgreSQL services.</br></p>
<p><b>What we learned? </b> <br> Teamwork, Patience and basic SQL functions that allowed us to create, alter and delete tables. </br><p> 
<h3>Sprint 2 Planning:</h3> 
<ol>
<li>Completed Client-Side of application using Angular.JS and Bootstrap Libraries</li>
</ol>
